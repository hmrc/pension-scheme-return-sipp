## Importing the Collections

In order to interact with pension-scheme-return-sipp API from Postman you need to import the json files within the
Collections folder, into Postman.

* Open Postman
* Select collections tab and Import -> File -> Upload-> and select PSR_SIPP.postman_collection.json
* Select collections tab and Import -> File -> Upload-> and select LocalHost.postman_environment.json

### Notes

Postman collection for non-sipp can be found under pension-scheme-return service in directory with
same structure. Also stub project has exact same pattern.
